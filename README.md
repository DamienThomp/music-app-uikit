# Music App

Demo project built as a way to experiment with UIKit features like Collection View [Compositional Layouts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionviewcompositionallayout) and 
[Diffable Data Sources](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionviewdiffabledatasource). App design pattern loosely follows an MVVM with Coordinators pattern.
This is a work in progress and new things will be added overtime:

- Search Page
- Artist Page
- Playlist add/remove
- Album save/unsave 
- Artist follow/unfollow 
- Player (which will only play previews if available, Spotify ain't free)
- Unit and UI tests (TDD didn't happen üôÅ, next time)
