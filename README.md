# Music App

Demo project built to experiment with UIKit features like UICollectionView [Compositional Layouts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionviewcompositionallayout) and 
[Diffable Data Sources](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionviewdiffabledatasource). App design loosely follows an MVP with Coordinators pattern.
This is a work in progress and new things will be added overtime.

** NOTE: due to recent [deprecations in the web api](https://developer.spotify.com/blog/2024-11-27-changes-to-the-web-api). This project has broken views and some functionality will never be complete. I will be leaving this up as sample code. **

## Working Features

- Album and Playlist Page
- User Library Page
- Errors handled with content unavailable views
