# Music App

Demo project built to experiment with UIKit features like UICollectionView [Compositional Layouts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionviewcompositionallayout) and 
[Diffable Data Sources](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionviewdiffabledatasource). App design pattern loosely follows an MVVM with Coordinators pattern.
This is a work in progress and new things will be added overtime.
