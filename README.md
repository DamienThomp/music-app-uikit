# Music App

Demo project built to experiment with UIKit features like UICollectionView [Compositional Layouts](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionviewcompositionallayout) and 
[Diffable Data Sources](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uicollectionviewdiffabledatasource). App design pattern loosely follows an MVVM with Coordinators pattern.
This is a work in progress and new things will be added overtime.

## Working Features
- Onboarding and Authorization Flow
- Browse View with recommended tracks
- Album and Playlist Page
- User Library Page

## Future Improvements
- Search Page
- Artist Page
- Playlist add/remove
- Album save/unsave 
- Artist follow/unfollow 
- Player (which will only play previews if available, Spotify ain't free)
